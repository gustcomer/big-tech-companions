Addressing Glossary

Addresses (IPv4): unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
  - usually it is divided into two parts: Network Portion and Host Portion. Depending on the subnet mask there can also be subnet identifier bits borrowed from the Host Portion.
  - 32-bit numeric addresses written in decimal format, divided into four octets (each octet can range from 0 to 255).
  Special Addresses
    Private IP Addresses: Reserved for internal use within a network (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
    Loopback Address: special IP address used for testing network interfaces 127.0.0.1.
      - the Address Range is from 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 but usually 127.0.0.1 is used.
    Network Address: the first address in a subnet, used to identify the network itself. For example, 192.168.1.0 in a 192.168.1.0/24 network.
    Broadcast Address: Sends a message to all hosts in a network (e.g., 192.168.1.255 in a /24 subnet).
      - limited to the local network. Routers do not forward broadcast packets to other networks.
    Multicast Address: Used to send data to a group of hosts, which have joined a specific multicast group. Multicast is used for applications like streaming media.
      - Address Range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Broadcast Domain: logical area in a computer network where any broadcast sent by a device can be received by all other devices within the same domain.
  - Switches and hubs do not break up broadcast domains. Routers are used to separate broadcast domains.
  - in a subnet, the broadcast address is the address where all the host bits are set to 1, while the network bits remain unchanged (the last adrdress of the subnet domain).
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): used to specify IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. eg 192.168.1.0/24.
  - the number after the slash (/) represents the number of bits set to '1'. For example, /24 corresponds to 255.255.255.0.
Classes: always remember this intervals 0-128-192-224-240-255.
  Class A Network

  Class D Network
    - Address Range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
    - they do not have a subnet mask because they are used for Multicasting and not used for regular network routing (you cannot assign it to a host).
  Class E Network
    - Address Range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
    - These addresses are not routable on the public internet and are typically used for research or experimental purposes.
Default Masks: for Class A, B, and C networks it is 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0, and 255.255.255.0.
  aka Natural Masks
NAT (Network Address Translation): method used in networking to modify network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit.
NAT Table: data structure used by a router or firewall that performs Network Address Translation (NAT) to keep track of the mappings between private IP addresses and ports on the internal network and public IP addresses and ports on the external network.
Network Address Translation (NAT) Router: type of router that modifies the IP addresses of packets as they pass through it and allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for communication with external networks, such as the internet.
  - it enables Internet network clients with private IP addresses to access the internet.
  - it has functionality akin to that of a Proxy Server.
Private IP Addresses: no rout
  reserved for internal use within a network (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
Routing Subnets
  - when a device on one subnet wants to communicate with a device on another subnet, it sends the data to the router.
  Packet Forwarding: The router receives the packet, checks its routing table, and forwards the packet to the appropriate subnet based on the destination IP address.
  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): The router uses ARP to determine the MAC address of the destination device on the subnet. If the MAC address is not already in the router's ARP cache, it sends an ARP request to learn the address.
Subnet: it is possible to break a network (for instance a Class C) into smaller subnets.
  - the default subnet mask of a Class C network is 255.255.255.0, but you can borrow bits from the host to create subnet identifiers.
  - two subnets communicate through a router or a level 3 switch. When a device on one subnet wants to communicate with a device on another subnet, it sends the data to the router.
Subnet Identifier: When you subnet a network, you borrow bits from the host identifier to create a subnet identifier and divide the IP address into three parts.
  Network Identifier: Identifies the overall network.
  Subnet Identifier: Differentiates subnets within that network.
  Host Identifier: Identifies individual hosts within a subnet.
  - if you use the default subnet mask, you'll have only the original network and the Subnet Identifier won't exist.
Subnet Mask: 32-bit number used in IP networking to divide an IP address into network and host portions.
  Class A: 255.0.0.0 (binary: 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000) or yet /8
  Class B: 255.255.0.0 (binary: 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000) or yet /16
  Class C: 255.255.255.0 (binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000) or yet /24
  eg: the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 translates to 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 in binary
  Class A, B, C, or yet CIDR are ways to represent a subnet mask without the need to show the 32 bits.

STP (Shielded Twisted Pair): Includes an extra layer of shielding (usually a metal foil or braid) around the twisted pairs or around the entire cable, providing better protection against EMI and radio frequency interference (RFI).
Transceiver: act like a media converter. Convert or translate data sent by one protocol to another protocol.
  - can be used to convert the medium, keeping the same protocol (eg: to combat EMI, or increase the distance).
  - copper to fiber, fiber to copper, coaxial to fiber, copper to coaxial, copper to wireless.
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair): pairs of wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).

Routing

Administrative Distance (AD): value used by routers to rank the trustworthiness (believability) of a route.
  - lower AD is considered more believable or trustworthy.
  - AD table
    *Directly connected routes: 0 (most trusted, because it's directly on the router)
    *Static routes: 1 (manually configured routes are highly trusted)
    External BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): 20
    *Internal EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol): 90
    IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol): 100
    *OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): 110
    IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System): 115
    *RIP (Routing Information Protocol): 120 (least trusted among these common protocols)
    *External EIGRP: 170
    Internal BGP: 200
    *Unknown routes: 255 (indicating the route is unreachable)
  - each route has a metric, and usually the smaller the value of the metric, the better. (Hop Count, Believability, Reliability, Bandwidth, Delay, Costs, ...)
Autonomous System (AS): collection of IP networks and routers under the control of a single organization or entity that presents a common routing policy to the internet.
  - a network or a group of networks that is managed by one organization and has a unified internal routing strategy.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): EGP that uses path vector that uses the number of Autonomous System (AS) hops instead of router hops.
  - it is the backbone of the internet, as paths move from one ISP to another.
Convergence: time it takes for routers to update their routing tables in response to a topology change.
  - after all routers know each other, we have a Converged Network.
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP): IGP that used hybrid of distance vector and link state protocols.
  - is a proprietary Cisco protocol that is popular in Cisco-only networks.
Hold-down Timer: prevents updates for a specific period of time and speeds up convergence (counterintuitive).
Hop Count: number of routers from the source router through which data must pass to reach the destination network.
Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS): IGP based on Link State that also uses cost and functions like OSPF, but not as widely popular.
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF): IGP based on Link State (uses Link Speed).
Poison Reverse: causes a route received on one interface to be advertised back out of that same interface with a metric considered to be infinite.
  - it has a similar function to Split Horizon.
Router: forwards traffic between subnets, between an internal and external network, or between two external networks.
Router Advertisement Method
  Distance Vector: only cares about Hop Count. Sends full copy of routing table to its directly-connected neighbors at regular intervals.
    - you would wan't to go through only one router, even if it's slower.
    - it has slow convergence time.
    - used in (RIP)
  Link State: takes link speed into account. (used in OSPF, IS-IS)
    - requires all routers to know about the paths that all other routers can reach in the network.
    - used in (OSPF)
  Hybrid
Routing Information Protocol (RIP): an IGP that uses Distance Vector Protocol (hop counts). It uses hop counts to figure out the fastest paths.
  - 16 hops is infinite. updates every 30 seconds. runs over UDP
Routing Loops: occurs when a packet is continuously transmitted within a network, circling between routers without reaching its intended destination.
  - techniques to prevent Routing Loops (Split Horizon, Poison Reverse). Other mechanisms to prevent could include Time-to-Live (TTL).
Routing Protocols: algorithms that allow routers to communicate with each other, exchange information, and determine the best path for forwarding data across networks.
  Internal (Interior Gateway Protocols - IGP): used within a single autonomous system (AS). (eg: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS)
  External (External Gateway Protocols - EGP): used to route data between different autonomous systems. (eg: BGP)
Routing Table: file in a router or a networked computer that lists the routes to particular network destinations. Each table entry has the following columns.
  Destination Network: The IP address or network that the router is trying to reach.
  Subnet Mask: Defines the network portion of the destination IP address, used for matching the destination address.
  Next Hop: The next device (usually another router) where the packet should be forwarded to reach its final destination.
  Metric: A value that helps the router choose the best path when multiple routes to the same destination exist (lower metrics are preferred). Metrics might represent hop count, bandwidth, delay, or other factors.
  Interface: The outgoing interface or port on the router used to forward the packet to the next hop.
  - eg:
    Destination    Subnet Mask    Next Hop      Metric    Interface
    192.168.1.0    255.255.255.0  192.168.2.1   1         eth0
    192.168.2.0    255.255.255.0  192.168.3.1   2         eth1
    0.0.0.0        0.0.0.0        192.168.1.1   0         eth0
  - 0.0.0.0/0 (Default Route): If no specific route is found for a packet, it will be sent to the next hop at 192.168.1.1 (the default gateway) via eth0.
    - "if you don't know where to go, just go here"
  - more specific (longest prefix) entries 
  - the Routing Tables can contain static entries (static routes) or dynamic entries (dynamic routes) discovered and updated by routing protocols like OSPF or RIP;
Sources of Routing Information
  Directly Connected Route: routers physically connected to the router.
  Static Routes: manually configured by an administrator.
    - there is always one static router configured in every router 0.0.0.0/0
  Dynamic Route: learned by exchanging information between routers.
Split Horizon: prevents a route learned on one interface from being advertised back out of that same interface.
  - it has a similar function to Poison Reverse.

Standards

IEEE 802.3: still evolving collection of standards defining the physical layer and data link layer's media access control (MAC) of wired Ethernet.
  - it also defines a LAN access method using CSMA/CD.
RFC 1918: specifies the allocation of private IP addresses for use within private networks. It was published in 1996 and helps manage IP address space efficiently without burdening the public address space.
