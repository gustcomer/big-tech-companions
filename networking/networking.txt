Glossary

10Base5 (Thicknet): transmission speed of 10Mbps, and up to 500 meters. 
  - uses a bus topology and coaxial cables, with devices connecting to it with "Vampire Taps" and a AUI (Attachment Unit Interface).
  - adopted by the 802.3 Ethernet in 1983 and obsolete by mid-1990s, replaced by 10Base-T with twisted pair cables.
ARP:
Baseband: transmits digital signals occupying the entire bandwidth of the communication.
  - LAN and its Ethernet protocol usually uses Baseband.
  - usualy it uses TDM.
Broadband: multiple signals or data streams can be transmitted simultaneously over the same communication medium by modulating them onto different frequency ranges (or channels)
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):
CRC
Ethernet: family of local area network (LAN) technologies that share some main features. Defined by the IEEE 802.3 Standard. Consisting of the Ethernet 
  - it operates at both Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model.
  - it was the main competitor of Token Ring, but Ethernet won the battle.
  - it uses a hybrid star-bus topology.
  - Ethernet medium access method is CSMA/CD.
  - what changes in each LAN technologies is just> basic topology, frame type, access method.
Ethernet Frames: the most used is Ethernet II (DIX frame), but there is also IEEE 802.3.
  Preamble (7 bytes): sequence of alternating 1s and 0s used for synchronization between the sending and receiving devices.
  Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) (1 byte): unique byte (10101011 in binary) that indicates the start of the Ethernet frame.
  Destination MAC Address (6 bytes): Media Access Control (MAC) address of the destination device on the network.
  Source MAC Address (6 bytes): MAC address of the source device that is sending the frame.
  EtherType/Length (2 bytes): indicates either the type of protocol encapsulated in the payload (EtherType) or the length of the payload in bytes. Common EtherTypes include IPv4 (0x0800), ARP (0x0806), and IPv6 (0x86DD)
  Payload/Data (46-1500 bytes): actual data being transmitted. If the payload is less than 46 bytes, padding is added to reach the minimum length.
  Padding: optional and added when the payload is less then 46 bytes.
  Frame Check Sequence (FCS) (4 bytes): a CRC checksum
  aka: layer 2 frame, MAC frame.
FDM: 
Layer 2 Data Link: handles communication between devices on the same network. Among the functions we have:
  1-Framing: it divides raw bits into chunks called Frames. In case of ethernet protocol, they are called Ethernet Frames.
  2-Error Detection: usually some kind of CRC checksum is appended to the end of the Frame.
  3-Error Correction: it is done sending redundant bits and using Forward Error Correction techniques like Hamming codes and Reed-Solomon codes.
  4-Flow Control
  5-Media Access Control
  6-Physical Addressing
  7-Logical Link Control
  8-Handling Collisions
Local Area Network (LAN): network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area.
  - can be connected through physical cables (Ethernet) or wirelessly (Wi-Fi).
  - Switches are the central devices in a LAN.
MAC Address (Media Access Control): unique identifier assigned to network interface controllers (NIC) for communications at the data link layer.
  - typically 48 bits long and usually displayed as six pairs of hexadecimal digits 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
  - the first 24 bits (first three pairs) represent the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI).
  - the last 24 bits (last three pairs) are specific to the Network Interface Controller.
Medium Access Method: manner a computer gain and controls access to the networkâ€™s physical medium.
  eg: CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, Token Passing, Demand Priority.
Modes of Data Transmission:
  Simplex: the data travels only in one direction with a Transmitter sending signals to an Emitter.
  Half-Duplex: when signals travel in both directions, but one at a time.
  Full-Duplex: two-way communications.
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS): 
Network Layer: third layer in the OSI model.
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI):
  7 Application
  6 Presentation: translates data between the application layer and the network format.
    - this is the layer to put encryption, compression, encoding stuff.
  5 Session: manages and controls the connections (sessions) between computers. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
  4 Transport: ensures reliable data transfer between two devices, providing error recovery and flow control. It segments data into smaller pieces, transfers them, and reassembles them at the destination.
    - it worries with the whole segment of data, reassembling data to form a bigger part, recovering from errors and not overflooding the destination.
  3 Network: responsible for routing data between devices on different networks.
    - it assures that a single packet from some ip arrives at another ip. It doesn't care about the combination of packets to form whole pieces.
  2 Data Link
  1 Physical
Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI): 24-bit number assigned by the IEEE that uniquely identifies a vendor, manufacturer, or organization worldwide.
  Individual/Group (I/G) bit: last bit (b0) of the first OUI octet within the MAC address that indicates whether the address is an individual (unicast, 0) address or a group (multicast, 1) address.
  Universal/Local (U/L) bit: indicates whether the MAC address is universally (0) or locally (1) administered. Universally means it is the only MAC in the world.
POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3): protocol used for retrieving emails from a remote mail server to a local client over a TCP/IP connection.
  - operates on port 110 by default. But if SSL/TLS is used to secure the connection, then it operates on port 995.
  - IMAP is another email retrieval protocol, but IMAP doesn't pop the email from the server and you can read them from multiple devices.
Protocol Data Unit (PDU): refer to a specific unit of data that is transmitted across a network.
  Layer 1: bit
  Layer 2: frame
  Layer 3: packet
  Layer 4: TCP segment , UDP datagram.
  Layer 5-7: message or data.
Shielded Twisted Pairs (STP):
Star-Bus Topology:
TDM:
Unshielded Twisted Pairs (UTP):
Wide Area Network (WAN): network that spans a large geographical area connecting smaller LAN or MAN area networks.

Standards

IEEE 802.3: still evolving collection of standards defining the physical layer and data link layer's media access control (MAC) of wired Ethernet.
  - it also defines a LAN access method using CSMA/CD.
