DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks.
  1 Discovery: A device (client) connects to a network and broadcasts a DHCP discovery message to find a DHCP server.
  2 Offer: The DHCP server responds with a DHCP offer message, which includes an available IP address and network configuration details.
  3 Request: The client sends a DHCP request message back to the server, indicating its acceptance of the offered IP address.
  4 Acknowledgment: The DHCP server sends a DHCP acknowledgment message, confirming the lease of the IP address and providing the client with the necessary network configuration.
Ethernet: family of local area network (LAN) technologies that share some main features. Defined by the IEEE 802.3 Standard. Consisting of the Ethernet 
  - it operates at both Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model.
  - it was the main competitor of Token Ring, but Ethernet won the battle.
  - it uses a hybrid star-bus topology.
  - Ethernet medium access method is CSMA/CD.

Layer 2 Data Link: [Link Layer] handles communication between devices on the same network. Among the functions we have:
  1-Framing: it divides raw bits into chunks called Frames. In case of ethernet protocol, they are called Ethernet Frames.
  2-Error Detection: usually some kind of CRC checksum is appended to the end of the Frame. It could also use parity check.
  3-Error Correction: it is done sending redundant bits and using Forward Error Correction techniques like Hamming codes and Reed-Solomon codes.
  4-Flow Control: in some cases it uses some techniques of flow control like Stop-and-Wait or Sliding Window. It is more common in layer 4. Ethernet usually is not used in Ethernet.
  5-Media Access Control: determines how devices on the same network gain access to the physical medium with techniques like CSMA/CD or CSMA/CA.
  6-Physical Addressing: each device on a LAN has a MAC address.
  7-Logical Link Control: usually do Multiplexing, Error Detection, Flow Control. But are not present in every protocol.
  8-Handling Collisions: after a collision happen there are algorithms such as Backoff Algorithms. Modern ethernet uses Full-Duplex which eliminates collisions.

  - can be connected through physical cables (Ethernet) or wirelessly (Wi-Fi).
  - Switches are the central devices in a LAN.
MAC Address (Media Access Control): unique identifier assigned to network interface controllers (NIC) for communications at the data link layer.

    - it worries with the whole segment of data, reassembling data to form a bigger part, recovering from errors and not overflooding the destination.
  3 Network: responsible for routing data between devices on different networks.
    - it assures that a single packet from some ip arrives at another ip. It doesn't care about the combination of packets to form whole pieces.
  2 Data Link
  1 Physical

  port 110 (unencrypted).
  port 995 (encrypted).
  - operates on port 110 by default. But if SSL/TLS is used to secure the connection, then it operates on port 995.
