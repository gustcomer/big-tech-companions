Create a github project mirrored to your local computer.

  go to your github account
  new repository
  choose a repository-name
  set public
  add a readme file
  add a .gitignore if the case
  choose a license

  don't create the folder! it will be created with the repo name on github
  git clone https://github.com/gustcomer/reponame.git


VS Code can do this process of creating the github repo for you

You can't first create a local repository and then create the github counterpart

You can do all in the command line without entering the github.com website if
you gave github cli installed in your local machine

Commit changes to the local git and then push to github
  create/change some files
  > git status | check if everything is ok
  > git add -A | add all files that were changed
  ou > git add .
  > git commit -m "git-companion: initial"
  [once] > git remote add origin https://github.com/gustcomer/big-tech-companions
    actually it's not necessary because the clone already sets origin
  [once] > git push -u origin main
  [after] > git push

.gitignore
  / at the begining - the pattern is relative to the .gitignore directory
  node_modules/ - node_modules directory @ root of the git project (absolute)
  /node_modules/ - node_modules directory @ .gitignore folder (relative)
  node_modules - node_modules directory or node_modules file
