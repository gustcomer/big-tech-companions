Create a github project mirrored to your local computer.

  go to your github account
  new repository
  choose a repository-name
  set public
  add a readme file
  add a .gitignore if the case
  choose a license

  don't create the folder! it will be created with the repo name on github
  git clone https://github.com/gustcomer/reponame.git


Commit changes to the local git and then push to github
  create/change some files
  > git status | check if everything is ok
  > git add -A | add all files that were changed
  ou > git add .
  > git commit -m "git-companion: initial"
  [once] > git remote add origin https://github.com/gustcomer/big-tech-companions
    actually it's not necessary because the clone already sets origin
  [once] > git push -u origin main
  [after] > git push
