AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol): The protocol used by RabbitMQ for messaging.
Broker: check Message Broker
Consume: receive a message
Consumer: An application that receives messages. It subscribes to a queue and processes messages coming from RabbitMQ.
Direct Exchange: routes messages to queues based on the exact match of a routing key.
  - often used for simple point-to-point messaging.
Exchange: routing mechanism in RabbitMQ. It receives messages from producers and pushes them to one or more queues based on routing rules defined by the exchange type.
  - Exchange and Routers means almost the same thing.
  - there is no direct Router concept in RabbitMQ. We say that an exchange is a message routing agent.
  - there are various types of exchange (direct, topic, fanout, headers). Each one has a routing algorithm.
Fanout Exchange: routes all incoming messages to all queues that are bound to it.
Headers Exchange: routes messages based on matching header values rather than the routing key.
Message: Data transported between producers and consumers. It can include any kind of information, such as simple text, serialized objects, or JSON.
Message Broker: decouple the production of a message from its consumption.
  - an Exchange is one part of a Message Broker.
  - Brokers encompasses more than just routing, including queue management, message buffering, acknoledgement delivery, etc.
Message Queueing: receive messages from sender applications and places them in queues.
  - a message broker uses a message queue.
Point-to-Point: ensures that only one receiver will receive a particular message.
Point-to-Point: messages are sent to a specific queue and a single consumer receives and processes messages from the queue. This ensures that a particular message is processed only once, by one consumer.
  - Point-to-Point Channel according to EIP book.
  - aka Queue-based Messaging
Produce: send a message.
Producer: a program that sends messages.
Publish-Subscribe: broadcast an event to all interested receivers.
Publish-Subscribe: allows messages to be published to all interested subscribers through an intermediary, typically called a topic.
  - Publish-Subscribe Channel according to EIP book.
  - aka Pub/Sub pattern, or even Observer Pattern.
Queue: A buffer that stores messages.
  - consumers connect to a queue to receive messages.
  - in the context of Enterprise Integration Patterns, Channels are known as Queues.
RabbitMQ: a message broker, it accepts and forwards messages.
  - it accepts, stores, and forwards binary blobs of data â€’ messages.
Router: routes messages to Queues.
  - Exchange and Routers means almost the same thing.
Topic: key concept in the context of publish/subscribe models. A channel or a specific subject to which messages are published by producers (senders) and from which messages are received by subscribers (listeners).
Topic Exchange: type of exchange in RabbitMQ that routes messages to queues based on wildcard matches between the routing key and the routing pattern specified by the queue.
