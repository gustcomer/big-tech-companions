  Global Configuration Mode: (config)# allows you to make system-wide configuration changes. allows you to enter more specific configuration modes (such as interface configuration).
  Interface Configuration Mode: (config-if)# allows you to configure individual network interfaces (Ethernet, Serial, etc). accessed from global configuration mode
IOS-XE: modern, modular version of the Cisco IOS (Internetwork Operating System).
running-configuration: current configuration settings stored in the RAM that are actively running on a Cisco device.

> enable | > en: switch from user EXEC mode to privileged EXEC mode.
> exit: moves you back one level in the command hierarchy.
> end: takes you all the way back to privileged EXEC mode.
> configure terminal | > conf t: enter Global Configuration Mode.
> hostname: used to set or change the name of the device (such as a router or switch).
> show ip interface brief: provides a summary of the status and configuration of the interfaces on a Cisco device.
> interface vlan 1: enter Interface Configuration Mode of the VLAN named 1.
> no shutdown | > no shut: enable an interface that is currently administratively down (disabled).
> ip add 192.168.1.201 255.255.255.0 : set an ip to a device like switch or router.
> ping 192.168.1.201 : ping some ip.
> show vlan : show VLANs.
> copy running-config startup-config : save settings of a device before quitting.
> write | wr : save settings of a device before quitting.
> show mac address | > sh mac a : show the mac address table of the device.
to check the MAC Address of the device you could:
  > show version
> show mac address-table | > show mac add : used to show the mac address table in switches.
> clear mac ad
> show running-config | > sh run : show running configurations of the switch.
> line vty 0 4 : enter specific config mode of 5 telnet channels to be used. line is used to configure a terminal line, while vty means virtual terminal. check the running-configurations
  notice that it takes you to the specific config of the line
> login : inside the config-line mode, it allows connections to this line. but usually a password must be set.
> password mypassword set the password of a line to mypassword
> enable password cisco : this command in configuration mode allows you to set a password to enter the enable mode.
> int loop 1 : create a virtual loopback interface in a router, for instance
  > ip address 192.168.100.254 255.255.255.0 : then, inside the config of the interface, assign an ip to this virtual network.
> show interface g0/0/0 : show details of some interface of the router
