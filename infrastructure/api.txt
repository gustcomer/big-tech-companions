REST

hypermedia: combination of hypertext and multimidea.
hypertext: structured text containing links to other text.
resource: any entity that can be identified, named, and addressed.
  - they are abstract concepts identified by URIs.
REST (Representational State Transfer): architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems emphasizing stateless interactions, scalability, and a uniform interface.
  - it was introduced in 2000 by computer scientist Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation.
REST constraints
RESTful: An application that adheres to the REST architectural constraints.
