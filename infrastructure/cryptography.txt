Glossary

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): symmetric encryption algorithm adopted by the U.S. government in 2001.
  - operates on block sizes of 128 bits, with key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
  - widely used in securing sensitive data and modern cryptographic protocols.
Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Cryptography): encryption method that uses a pair of keys, one for encryption and another for decryption.
  - commonly used algorithms: RSA, ECC.
Ciphertext (y): encrypted or encoded text that is the result of applying an encryption algorithm to plaintext.
  - cannot be easily read or understood without the appropriate key for decryption.
  - contrasts with plaintext, which is readable data.
Communication over Insecure Channel: Alice wants to send a secure message x to Bob over an insecure channel. But doesn't want Oscar to intercept the message. It is the basic framework to apply cryptography.
  - the solution is to encrypt the plaintext x with some encryption function e, and then decrypt the cyphertext y with some decryption function d.
Cryptanalysis: the study of analyzing cryptographic systems to break them or understand weaknesses.
  - involves techniques like frequency analysis, brute-force attacks.
  - goal is to decrypt ciphertext without the key.
Cryptographic Key (k): string of data used in encryption and decryption processes to secure information.
Cryptography: practice of creating methods to encode information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during storage or transmission.
  - it involves Symmetric Algorithms (AES, DES) and Asymmetryc Algorithms (RSA, ECC).
Cryptography Protocols: standardized procedures and rules that use cryptographic methods to secure data exchange and ensure privacy, integrity, and authentication in communications.
  eg: TLS/SSL, IPsec, PGP, Kerberos.
Cryptology: science of secure communication.
  - it involves cryptography (creating codes and ciphers to protect information, the good guys) and cryptanalysis (breaking or analyzing these codes, the bad guys).
Cryptosystem: structured set of cryptographic algorithms and protocols designed to secure data through encryption and decryption processes.
Decryption Function (d): algorithm that reverses the encryption process, transforming ciphertext (encoded data) back into its original plaintext form using cryptographic key k.
Encryption Function (e): algorithm that transforms plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (encoded data) using a cryptographic key k.
Insecure Channel: communication medium where data can be intercepted, eavesdropped on, or tampered with by unauthorized parties.
Key Space |k|: the set of all possible keys.
Plaintext (Cleartext, x): readable or unencrypted data that is input into an encryption algorithm to produce ciphertext.
  - can be text, files, or other data in its original form.
  - contrasts with ciphertext, which is the output of encryption.
Secure Channel: communication medium that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data exchanged between parties, preventing eavesdropping or tampering by unauthorized individuals.
  - they use cryptographic protocols (like TLS/SSL or IPsec) to encrypt data and often include mechanisms for authentication and integrity verification.
Stream Cipher: encryption algorithms that encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, using a keystream generated from a secret key.
Symmetric Encryption: encryption method that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
  - commonly used algorithms: AES, DES.
  - faster than asymmetric encryption but requires secure key distribution.
Symmetric-key Cryptosystem: Alice encrypts her message x using a symmetric algorithm e(), yielding the ciphertext y. Bob receives the ciphertext and decrypts the message with d().
  - the ciphertext will look like random bits to Oscar and will contain no information whatsoever that is useful to him.
