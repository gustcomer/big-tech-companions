Glossary

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): symmetric-key block cipher (encryption algorithm) adopted by the U.S. government in 2001.
  - operates on block sizes of 128 bits, with key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
  - widely used in securing sensitive data and modern cryptographic protocols.
Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Cryptography): encryption method that uses a pair of keys, one for encryption and another for decryption.
  - commonly used algorithms: RSA, ECC.
Block Cipher: type of encryption algorithm that transforms fixed-size blocks of plaintext data into ciphertext using a cryptographic key. It operates on data in chunks or "blocks," typically of 64 or 128 bits.
Brute Force Attack (Exhaustive Keysearch): attacker tries every possible key until they find the correct one.
Ciphertext (y): encrypted or encoded text that is the result of applying an encryption algorithm to plaintext.
  - cannot be easily read or understood without the appropriate key for decryption.
  - contrasts with plaintext, which is readable data.
Communication over Insecure Channel: Alice wants to send a secure message x to Bob over an insecure channel. But doesn't want Oscar to intercept the message. It is the basic framework to apply cryptography.
  - the solution is to encrypt the plaintext x with some encryption function e, and then decrypt the cyphertext y with some decryption function d.
Cryptanalysis: the study of analyzing cryptographic systems to break them or understand weaknesses.
  - involves techniques like frequency analysis, brute-force attacks.
  - goal is to decrypt ciphertext without the key.
Cryptographic Key (k): string of data used in encryption and decryption processes to secure information.
Cryptography: practice of creating methods to encode information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during storage or transmission.
  - it involves Symmetric Algorithms (AES, DES) and Asymmetryc Algorithms (RSA, ECC).
Cryptography Protocols: standardized procedures and rules that use cryptographic methods to secure data exchange and ensure privacy, integrity, and authentication in communications.
  eg: TLS/SSL, IPsec, PGP, Kerberos.
Cryptology: science of secure communication.
  - it involves cryptography (creating codes and ciphers to protect information, the good guys) and cryptanalysis (breaking or analyzing these codes, the bad guys).
Cryptosystem: structured set of cryptographic algorithms and protocols designed to secure data through encryption and decryption processes.
Decryption Function (d): algorithm that reverses the encryption process, transforming ciphertext (encoded data) back into its original plaintext form using cryptographic key k.
DES (Data Encryption Standard): symmetric-key block cipher (encryption algorithm) created in the 1970s.
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE): allows two parties to securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel without directly transmitting the key itself.
  Steps
    1. Alice and Bob choose numbers g and n and publish them in the public space.
      p should be a large prime number.
      the generator g should be large a primitive root of p.
    2. Alice picks a large number a, and Bob picks a large number b. a and b don't need to be primes. They should be kept in secret.
    3. Alice calculates A=(g^a)mod n and Bob calculates B=(g^b)mod p. Then they send each other the result. To find out the a and b is the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DSP) which is hard to solve.
    4. Alice receives B and calculate the key S=(B^a)mod p. Bob calculates the key S=(A^b)mod p. S=(g^ab)mod p or S=(g^ba)mod p.
    4. S is used as a symmetric key for other algorithms such as AES or DES.
  DH Computational Assumption: if g, g^a, g^b are in the public space, it is computationally intractable to Oscar to compute g^ab. (don't confuse with the computation of g^(a+b) which is easy to calculate).
Encryption Function (e): algorithm that transforms plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (encoded data) using a cryptographic key k.
Feistel Netowork: 
Insecure Channel: communication medium where data can be intercepted, eavesdropped on, or tampered with by unauthorized parties.
Kerckhoffs's Principle: (1883) states that a cryptographic system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.
Key Space |k|: the set of all possible keys.
Modes of Operation: in block ciphers define how encryption is applied to data larger than a single block.
  ECB (Electronic Codebook)
  CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
  CFB (Cipher Feedback)
  OFB (Output Feedback)
  GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
Plaintext (Cleartext, x): readable or unencrypted data that is input into an encryption algorithm to produce ciphertext.
  - can be text, files, or other data in its original form.
  - contrasts with ciphertext, which is the output of encryption.
RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman): asymmetric encryption introduced in 1977. Based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of factoring two large prime numbers.
  - consists of 3 steps Key Generation, Encryption, and Decryption.
  totient:  function φ(n) that counts how many integers between 1 and n are coprime
  1 Key Generation
    - Choose two large prime numbers, p and q.
    - Compute n = p * q. The value n is used as part of the public and private keys.
    - Calculate φ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1), where φ is Euler's totient function.
    - Choose a public exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and e is coprime with φ(n). Common choices for e are 3, 17, and 65537.
    - Compute the private exponent d, which satisfies d * e ≡ 1 mod φ(n). This is done using the modular multiplicative inverse.
    - The public key is (e, n), and the private key is (d, n).
  2 Encryption
    - Convert the plaintext into an integer m such that 0 <= m < n.
    - Compute the ciphertext c using the formula: c = m^e mod n
    - The ciphertext c is sent to the recipient.
  3 Decryption
    - The recipient uses their private key (d, n) to recover the plaintext m using the formula: m = c^d mod n
    - The plaintext is converted back into its original form.
Secure Channel: communication medium that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data exchanged between parties, preventing eavesdropping or tampering by unauthorized individuals.
  - they use cryptographic protocols (like TLS/SSL or IPsec) to encrypt data and often include mechanisms for authentication and integrity verification.
SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm): family of cryptographic hash functions.
  - it is used in Integrity Checks, Digital Signatures, Password Hashing (specialized algos such as bcrypt, scrypt are preferred), proof of work in block chains.
  SHA-0: released in 1993, has security weakness and is obsolete.
  SHA-1: 1995, has a digest size of 160 (produces a 160-bit hash value). Considered insecure because cryptoanalysts discovered practical collisions.
  SHA-2: 2001, has many variantes such as SHA-256 (256-bit). It is based on the Merkle–Damgård construction.
  SHA-3: 2015, based on the Keccak algorithm, or sponge construction.
Stream Cipher: encryption algorithms that encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, using a keystream generated from a secret key.
Substitution Cipher: method of encryption where each letter or symbol in the plaintext is replaced by another letter or symbol to create the ciphertext.
  eg: Simple Substitution Cipher, Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Affine Cipher.
  Caesar Cipher: each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places in the alphabet, some other methods use other substitution tables.
  - to break a substitution table with for each letter would take 26! or 2^88 combinations. 2^56 is feasible, but more than that is complicated. The key space is too large!
  - a Letter Frequencu Analysis could be used to attack.
Symmetric Encryption: encryption method that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
  - commonly used algorithms: AES, DES.
  - faster than asymmetric encryption but requires secure key distribution.
Symmetric-key Cryptosystem: Alice encrypts her message x using a symmetric algorithm e(), yielding the ciphertext y. Bob receives the ciphertext and decrypts the message with d().
  - the ciphertext will look like random bits to Oscar and will contain no information whatsoever that is useful to him.
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access): security protocol developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance designed to secure wireless networks.
  - it addresses the vulnerabilities of the older WEP protocol.
  - uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to replace WEP's weak encryption system.
