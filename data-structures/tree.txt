Tree Structure (Traditional)
================================================================================
Model

A Tree consists of Nodes with parent-children relationships.

Glossary

Tree: consists of Nodes with parent-children relationships (Edges).
  Root: the top node of a tree.
  Height: maximum depth of any node.
  Degree: maximum degree of a node in the tree.
  Size: number of nodes in the tree.
  Breadth of the Tree: the number of leaves.
  Subtree: a node and its descendants.

Node: fundamental unit of a tree structure, representing an individual element that stores data and has references (or pointers) to other nodes.
  Ancestors: parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, etc.
  Child: Node below.
  Data: the value or information contained within the node.
  Leaf: any node that does not have child nodes.
    aka: Terminal Nodes, Outer Node, Terminal Node, External Node.
  Edges: the connection of one node to other nodes. It represents parent-children relationships.
    aka: Links, References, Pointers, Relationships.
  Parent: upper node.
  Descendants: children, grandchildren.
  Neighbor: parent or child.
  Degree: number of children.
  Distance between two nodes: number of edges along the shortest path.
  Internal Node: any node of a tree that has child nodes.
    aka: Inner Node, Inode, Branch Node.
  Siblings: children of the same parent.
  Depth: number of ancestors.
    or: number of edges along the unique path between it and the root node.
    aka: Level.

Forest: set of disjoint trees.


================================================================================
Invariants

  each node must be connected to only one parent.
  the root has no parent.
  no node can be its own ancestor (there are no cycles or loops).
