Glossary

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):
Ethernet: family of local area network (LAN) technologies that share some main features.
  - it operates at both Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model.
  - it was the main competitor of Token Ring, but Ethernet won the battle.
  - it uses a hybrid star-bus topology.
  - Ethernet medium access method is CSMA/CD.
Local Area Network (LAN): network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area.
  - can be connected through physical cables (Ethernet) or wirelessly (Wi-Fi).
  - Switches are the central devices in a LAN.
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS): 
Network Layer: third layer in the OSI model.
Shielded Twisted Pairs (STP):
Unshielded Twisted Pairs (UTP):
Wide Area Network (WAN): network that spans a large geographical area connecting smaller LAN or MAN area networks.

Standards

IEEE 802.3: still evolving collection of standards defining the physical layer and data link layer's media access control (MAC) of wired Ethernet.
  - it also defines a LAN access method using CSMA/CD.
