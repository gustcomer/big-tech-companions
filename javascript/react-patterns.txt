Compound Component: design pattern that involves creating a parent component that maintains the state and provides context, and several child components that work together under this parent component.
  - the Child components are kept under the same file and are named MainComponent.ChildComponent preferably with the dot.
  - the state is passed to the child components via context and accessed with useContext, and not via props.
Container Components: components responsible for data loading and data management in behalf of its children components.
  - they usually manage data with useState, load data with useEffect and pass data to children as props.
  - we use Container components because we want our components to be unaware of the source or management of their data.
  - the children components should simply receive props and display data, without worrying too much.
Layout Components: specialized components that focus on organizing other components within a web page.
  - eg: split screen, lists, modals.

### Screen Splitter
- this is a Layout Component Pattern from CodeLicks.
<SplitScreen />: name of the main component
<Right />: prop passed to <SplitScreen /> to render in the right.
<Left />: prop passed to <SplitScreen /> to render in the left.
