Nextjs glossary

[...]: check Catch-all Segments.
[slug]: check Dynamic Route.
API Routes: allow you to create server-side endpoints as part of your application. These endpoints can be used to handle HTTP requests and serve as a backend for your application without requiring a separate backend service.
  - in Vercel or similar platforms, each API route is deployed as a serverless function, which scales automatically.
  - Next.js API routes are powered by a lightweight library Micro similar to Express, developed by Vercel. Both Micro and Express are lightweight HTTP frameworks designed for handling server-side requests and responses.
App directory: directory responsible for all the routing.
  - to make it work, it has to have a page.tsx file inside the folder representing the routing. Check File Colocation.
Autoprefixer: lib that manages css prefixes like -webkit, -moz.
Caching: route handlers are cached by default when using the GET method with the Response object in Next.
  - in development mode, each refresh means a a new Response, we don't cache.
  - in production mode, the results are cached
  - to opt out of caching change dynamic mode in Segment Config Option
  - to do that: export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
  - other ways to opt out:
    - use Request object with the GET method
    - employ dynamic functions like headers() and cookies()
    - use any HTTP method other than GET
Caching: by default, Next automatically caches the returned values of fetch in the Data Cache on the server.
  - Next extends the fetch API and automatically caches any values returned by the fetch.
Caching Mechanisms:
  - Request Memoization
  - Data Cache
  - Full Route Cache
  - Router Cache
Catch-all Segments: extend dynamic segments to to catch-all subsequent segments.
  - add an ellipsis inside the brackets [...folderName]
  - all segments are passed at the params prop in an array form. (remember nested dynamic routes used key-value pairs).
  - app/shop/[...slug]/page.js will route /shop/a/b/c and generate params: { slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }
  - in the case above, if you want to also match app/, you should check Optional Catch-all Segments entry and use [[...slug]].
Client Components:
  - they can use hooks, use event listeners and manage state.
client-only: package that prevent unintended server side usage of client side code.
  - client code interact with browser-specific features like DOM, window object, localStorage, etc.
  - useful when you have a function in some util folder that are intended solely for client use.
  - ensures that the code stays where it belongs enhancing reliability and mantainability.
Client-Side Rendering (CSR): component code is transformed into user interface directly in the browser.
  - not optimal for SEO.
  - performance issues since users might see a blank screen or a loading spinner while the page loads.
  - CSR laid the groundwork for interactive applications we see today, but lacks in SEO and performance.
Code Splitting: breaking up a large JavaScript bundle into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be loaded on-demand or in parallel.
  - it consists of a kind of Selective Hydration.
  - you can implement this using React.lazy() functionality.
Cookies: small pieces of data that a server sends to a user's web browser.
  - the browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests.
  - use cases: session management, personalizations, tracking and analysis of user behavior.
  - to set a cookie, send a response with "Set-Cookie" header and name-value: "Set-Cookie": "theme=dark"
  - to get a cookie from a request, use request.cookies.get("...")
  - as an alternative, you can use the cookies() function
cookies(): function to manipulate cookies
  - eg: const cookieStore = cookies(); cookieStore.get("theme"); or yet
  - eg: cookies().set("resultsPerPage", "20")
  - and to get the cookies: cookies().get("resultsPerPage")
  - there are additional functionalities such as "has", delete, etc
Core Web Vitals: subset of Web Vitals.
  - consists of Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measure of your site’s overall layout stability.
Data Cache: server-side cache that persists the result of data fetches across incoming server requests and deployments.
  - it improves app performance and eliminate the need to re-fetch data with every request.
  - in the Rendering phase, each fetch() checks if there is data on the Data Cache, if there aren't any, then it requests data to the Data Source.
  - the data is stored in .next/cache/fetch-cache
  - the Data Cache is a Server Cache, don't confuse it with the browser cache.
Data Fetching: process of retrieving data from an external source, such as an API, database, or file, to be used within a React application. Usually data is fetched from REST API or GraphQL, but also from databases, files, etc.
  - to fetch data from the Server Component, use async and await keywords in the component definition.
default.tsx: serves as a fallback to render content when the framework cannot retrieve a slot's active state from the current URL due to unmatched routes inside slots.
  - it's higly recommended that you have one default.tsx in each slot folder. You usually simply copy the code of the related page.tsx.
  - you should put a default.tsx in the parent folder that calls the slots as well.
  - this file processes slots without specific content for the route inside a slot.
  - I believe that you can put the same route inside different slots.
DELETE(): put this function inside a route.ts file to handle a DELETE request.
  - you can respond the request with return Response.json(...) or with return NextResponse.json({data})
  - export async function DELETE(_request: Request, {params}) {...}
Development Server: focuses on developer experience.
  - pages will be pre-rendered for every request
Dynamic Page Route: the process of putting a page.tsx inside a folder representing a dynamic route.
Dynamic Rendering: a Server Rendering Strategy where routes are rendered for each user at request time.
  - useful when a route has data that is personalized to the user or contains information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL's search parameters.
  - during rendering, if a dynamic function such as cookies() headers() searchParams are discovered, Next will switch to dynamically rendering automatically for the whole route.
  - dynamic routes are represented with a lambda sign.
Dynamic Route Handler: similar to Dynamic Page Route. Put a route.ts inside a folder representing a dynamic route.
  - useful for GET, PATCH, DELETE requests.
  - for GET: export async function GET(request: Request, { params }: { params: { id: string } })
Dynamic Routes: when you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data.
  - use Dynamic Segments for this purpose.
  - to use it you name the folder with square brackets, for example, [id] or [slug].
  snippet [https://github.com/gustcomer/schedmusic/commit/a9d6aedc7b8d1c8dea7fe971a6e6ba749c7297d1]
Dynamic Segment: when you don't know exact names of segment parts of the dynamic route, you can use Dynamic Segments to capture this dynamic data.
  - created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: [folderName]
  - they are passed as the params prop to layout, page, route, and generateMetadata functions.
error.tsx
  - the error component automatically creates a React Error Boundary that wraps a nested child segment or page.js component.
  - this error component receives and error object with an Error object containing information about the error.
  - also it receives a reset method, reset: () => void, that allows to retry if we end up in the Error Boundary (the Error Page).
  - by positioning error.tsx at different levels in the nested folders, you can achieve a more granular level of error handling.
Error Handling:
  - error boundaries must be client components in Next. 
  - a prop called error is passed to the Error component. You can get the error message from it.
  - in nested routes, errors bubble up to the closest parent error boundary.
  - taking into account the next structure, inserting an error.tsx will handle errors of the page at the same folder, but won't handle errors in the template nor the layout.
  - to handle errors in the layout or in the template, you should place error.tsx one folder above.
fetch(): check Data Fetching.
File Colocation: practice of organizing and grouping related files together in the same directory.
  - but in the App folder responsible for the routing, the route only has visibility if it has a page.tsx file and an export default component.
First Load JS: size when downloading the page from the server
First Load JS shared by all: includes global css, some runtime code, framweork code, react code, code related to routes and components.
font: automatically optimize your fonts, for instance, self-hosting any Google Font.
  - to use the font, insert fontname.className in the class of the component.
generateMetadata(): function used to define dynamic metadata.
  - you cannot export a static metadata and a generateMetadata function at the same time.
GET(): put this function inside a route.ts file to handle a get request.
  - you can respond the request with return Response.json(...) or with return NextResponse.json({data})
  - export async function GET(_request: Request, {params}) {...}
headers(): allows you to read the HTTP incoming request headers from a Server Components.
  - const headersList = headers(); or yet
  - headers().get('referer')
HTML Streaming: technique used to improve the performance of web applications by progressively sending chunks of HTML from the server to the client.
  - at first it does not include chunking the JavaScript code. To split the JavasScript bundle, check Code Splitting.
HTTP Headers: metadata associated with an API request and response.
Hydration: react takes control in the browser, reconstructing the component tree in memory based on the static HTML that was server.
  - for Selective Hydration and breaking up of the JavaScript bundle, check Code Splitting.
  - initialize application state
  - attach event handlers for actions
  - set up other dynamic functionalities
<Image>: 
  - required props: src, width, height, and alt.
  - fill(prop): causes the image to fill the parent element, which is useful when the width and height are unknown.
Independent Route Handling: each slot can have its own loading and error states.
Intercepting Routes: allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout when navigation through <Link/>.
  - if you refresh the page or type the address directly, it will show the original page, and not the intercepted one.
  - use case: show login modal when you're navigating, but show login page when you share the link or refresh.
  - define naming a subfolder as /(.)routename , this way it opens /(.)routename when clicking <Link/> and /routname when refreshing or sharing the link.
  - if the route you want to intercept is at the same level of your current route, use /(..)routename.
  - (.) match segments on the same level.
  - (..) match segments one level above.
  - (..)(..) match segments two levels above (has bugs).
  - (...) match segments from the root app directory.
Interleaving: you can place a Server Component inside a Client Component passing the SC as a prop.
key prop: string or a number that uniquely identifies items in an array.
Layout: UI that is shared between multiple routes. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render.
  - The component should accept a children prop and this chindren component will be inserted into the UI.
layout.tsx: special file that is shared between multiple routes and defines UI.
  - export some component as default and with children props.
Layout Shifting: when a visible element on your page changes position or size, affecting the position of content around it.
Lazy: React.lazy is a function that allows you to render a dynamic import as a regular component. It is part of React's support for code splitting, enabling you to load components lazily, i.e., only when they are needed.
<Link>: component that extends the HTML <a> element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes.
  - eg: <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
  - replace prop: when true, next/link will replace the current history state instead of adding a new URL into the browser’s history.
loading.tsx: this file allows us to create loading states that are displayed to users while a specific route segment's content is loading.
  - loading has to do with React Suspense.
Metadata API: allows you to define metadata for each page.
  - 2 methods: export a static metadata object or export a dynamic generateMetadata().
  - deeper page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have the same properties.
Middleware: allows you to run code before on the incoming request. You can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.
  - Use the file middleware.ts (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware.
  - the matcher config property is used to filter Middleware to run on specific paths.
  - it offers a robust way to intercept and control the flow of requests and responses within your applications.
  - aids redirection, URL rewrites, authentication, headers, cookies management, etc
  - we have different approaches to apply the middleware to a path
    - configure a matcher in a config file exported in the middleware file
    - use conditional conditions on request.nextUrl.pathname
  - we can manipulate the headers with response.headers.set("name","value")
  - we can manipulate cookies with response.cookies.set("name","value")
Nested Dynamic Routes: nested routes with more than one dynamic segment.
  - all dynamic segments will be passed as properties of Param props in the form of key-value pairs.
  - other way to capture multiple dynamic segments is using Catch All Segments.
  snippet [https://github.com/gustcomer/schedmusic/commit/258f336a77e0d526ebd5c42c4f3bb588cbbfaa4f]
Nested Layout: layouts in the folder hierarchy are nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their children prop.
Nested Routes: ability to create a hierarchical structure of pages that reflects a path hierarchy in the URL.
  - just pile up the folders and don't forget the file page.tsx.
Next.js: React-based framework for building web applications. React, in turn, can be considered a library for building user interfaces.
  - it takes care of Routing, Optimized Rendering, Data Fetching, Bundling, Compiling, Authentication, Deploy, Caching, Styling.
.next folder: build output directory that keeps static files and is automatically generated when you build or start your Next.js application.
  - within the /server we have an /app corresponding to the router
  - each static generated route is in this folder, and there is a .rsc respective file with the RSC payload
NextRequest: extends the Request Web Request API with additional convenience methods.
  - with request.nextUrl.searchParams we can access all query parameters.
  - check Request
Not Found Page: 404 not found page when the next router doesn't find any match, or programatically with notFound() function.
  - you customize the Not Found Page creating a not-found.tsx file.
  - it creates an ErrorBoundary.
not-found.tsx: file responsible for the customization of the Not Found Pages.
notFound(): function that calls the Not Found Page.
no-store: cache option to opt out of caching for individual data fetches.
  - const response = await fetch("http://...", {cache: "no-store"})
  - after you place a no-store fetch request, all subsequent fetches will also have no cache.
  - place all fetch requests that you want to cache before a fetch with no-store set.
  - an alternative is to configure a route level configuration
    - export const fetchCache = "default-cache"; route segment configuration
  - by default Next will cache fetch requests that occur before any dynamic functions like cookies(), headers(), searchParams are used.
  - it will not cache requests found after dynamic functions.
Optional Catch-all Segments: like catch all segments but will also match the original route;
  - use double square brackets [[..segmentName]].
page.tsx: special file that is unique to a route allows you to create UI for it.
  - put page.tsx exporting some component as default.
Parallel Routes: advanced routing mechanism that uses Slots and allows for the simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout.
  - useful for highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites.
  - you can have routes inside slots and this brings Unmatched Routes in other slots specially on page reloads. Treat it with default.tsx.
params: prop used to capture the value of dynamic segments as key-value pairs.
  - it is passed as prop to layout, page, route, and generateMetadata functions.
PATCH(): put this function inside a route.ts file to handle a PATCH request.
  - you can respond the request with return Response.json(...) or with return NextResponse.json({data})
  - export async function PATCH(_request: Request, {params}) {...}
POST(request): put this function inside a route.ts file to handle a post request.
  - use request parameter to access request body.
Postcss: tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript.
Prefetching: when a <Link /> component enters the user's viewport (initially or through scroll) Next.js prefetches and loads the linked route (denoted by the href) and data in the background to improve the performance of client-side navigations.
  - technique used to preload a route in the background before the user navigates to it.
Private Folder: indicate that it is a private implementation and should not be considered by the routing system.
  - prefix the folder name with an underscore _. The folder and all its subfolders are excluded from routing.
Production Server: optimized build is created once, and you deploy that build.
  - pages are pre-rendered once when we run build command.
redirect(): redirect the user to another URL.
  - can be used in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.
Rendering: process that transforms the code you write into user interfaces.
  - CSS, SSR, RSC: choosing the right time and place to render is vital.
Request: interface of the Fetch API representing a resource request
  - it has the Request type and lots of methods to return
  - in Next, it is preferable to use the NextRequest since it provides extra methods.
Request Headers: metadata sent by the client
  - 'User-Agent': identifies the browser and operating system. Useful for specific renderings and analytics.
  - 'Accept': indicates content types the Client can process. The server has the option to respond with one of these.
  - 'Authorization': header used by the client to authenticate itself to the server.
Request Memoization: type of cache that extends the fetch API to automatically memoize requests that have the same URL and options.
  - in a Component Tree, you don't need to fetch data at the top of the tree and forward props to optimize.
  - while Data Cache is a cache that works accross different renderings, Request Memoization works in the same rendering.
  - it is a React feature, not a Next.Js feature.
  - it is used to dedupe requests using React.cache.
  - only applies to GET method in fetch requests.
  - only applies within React Component Tree. Does not extend to fetch requests in Route Handlers.
reset(): an error component can use the reset() function to prompt the user to attempt to recover from the error. When executed, the function will try to re-render the Error boundary's contents.
  - the cause of an error can sometimes be temporary. In these cases, simply trying again might resolve the issue.
Response(): interface of the Fetch API represents the response to a request.
  - check Response() in javascript glossary.
  - there is a better alternative with NextResponse which provide additional convenience methods.
  - if you want to respond with code, pass a second object parameter with headers and status fields. Check documentation.
  - the second argument is the headers object, check documentation if you want to change "Content-Type" to text/html, for instance.
Response Headers: metadata sent back from the server to the client.
  - 'Content-Type': header that indicates the media type of the response. eg: text/html, application/json, etc.
Revalidation: process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data.
Root Layout: defined at the top level of the app directory and applies to all routes.
  - you can't get rid of this layout file. If you delete, it will reappear.
  - besides a normal Layout, it must contain html and body tags.
Route Group: organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.
  - wrap a folder's name in parenthesis: (folderName)
  - you can use layout files specific to the route group.
Route Group Layout: apply a layout to pages grouped by a Route Group.
  - you can create a specific rout group named (with-specific-layout).
Route Handlers: allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs.
  - use the file route.ts instead of page.ts in the App folder.
  - while page routes respond with html, route handlers allow you to create RESTful endpoints and respond with json, for instance.
  - you don't need to create and configure a separate server! no need to express.js
  - they run on server-side, can access databases, etc.
  - while page routes are router in the frontend, route handlers are routing in the backend.
Route Segment Configuration: allows you to configure the behavior of a Page, Layout or Route Handler  by directly exporting variables.
  - configuration variables that can be exported:
    - dynamic: 'auto' | 'force-dynamic' | 'error' | 'force-static'
    - dynamicParams: boolean
    - revalidate: false | 0 | number
    - fetchCache: 'auto' | 'default-cache' | 'only-cache' | 'force-cache' | 'force-no-store' | 'default-no-store' | 'only-no-store'
      - should only be used if you specifically need to override the default behavior.
    - runtime: 'nodejs' | 'edge'
    - preferredRegion: 'auto' | 'global' | 'home' | string | string[]
    - maxDuration: number
Route Types
  - Simple Routes: /about
  - Nested Routes: /info/about
  - Dynamic Routes: /artists/32
  - Nested Dynamic Routes: /artists/12/album/14
route.ts: file responsible for route handlers.
  - export async function GET() {return Response.json({ message: 'Hello - GET' });}
  - If there are page.ts and route.ts files in the same folder, page.ts takes precedence.
Routing: process of determining how an application or system directs a request to the appropriate destination.
  - it defines how requests to specific URLs are mapped to web pages and resources. eg: a POST request to /products would trigger a specific server function return a json resource.
  - the routing to some address could provide different responses depending on the user agent info.
  - Next.js uses a file-system based routing mechanism.
    1 All routes must live inside the app folder.
    2 Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
    3 Each folder represents a segment of the URL path.
  - Next has its own backend functionalities known as API Routes.
RSC Architecture: start using Client Components and Server Components in React.
RSC payload: data and components that are pre-rendered on the server and sent to the client to hydrate the application.
  - the payload is a binary containing
    - the rendered HTML in the server.
    - metadata about the structure of the component tree to update the browser's DOM.
    - any props from the Server Components to the Client Components (integration).
  - the RSC payload passes from React, to Next and then to the Browser.
  - comprises of pre-rendered HTML, Component State, Props and JavaScript Code.
  - we can find .rsc files in /.next/App related to each route, with a json string representing the virtual DOM.
  - for a Server Component we can even find the rendered html in this .rsc json file.
  - for Client Component the payload includes placeholders (instructions) about where the components should be rendered along with references to the js files.
  - we can find some of the js code related to components in /static/chunks/app/...
Selective Hydration: allows for the hydration of sections as they become available, before the rest of the HTML and the JavaScript code are fully downloaded.
  - check Code Splitting.
  - eg: const MainContent = lazy(() => import('./MainContent.js'));
Server Action: asynchronous functions that are executed on the server.
  - place the directive "use server" at the top of an async function.
Server Components:
  - they can access the server. but they can't use hooks, event listeners or manage state.
server-only: module that provides a build-time error if developers accidentaly import a module that should stay in the server into a Client Component.
  - to enable it, all you have to do is import "server-only" after installing it.
Server-Side Rendering: the server generate HTML and returns to the Client full HTML+JS reference translating into a non-interactive UI.
  - improves SEO
  - users can immediately see the page HTML content instead of a blank screen or loading spinner. Then it requests the referenced JS bundle and when it returns we'll have a full interactive page, this process is called hydration.
  - it is a kind of Server-side solution
  - Drawbacks:
    - Data fetching must be completed before the server can begin rendering HTML. (Solve with Suspense)
    - The JavaScript required for the components needs to be fully loaded on the client side before the hydration process can start. (Solve with Selective Hydration)
    - All components have to be hydrated before they become interactive. (Solve with Selective Hydration).
  - Server Rendering Strategies
    - Static Rendering.
    - Dynamic Rendering.
    - Streaming.
Slots: pieces of UI that do not represent routes and are defined with the @folder convention.
  - if you try to access them via route, you'll get a 404.
  - each slot allows for Independent Route Handling.
  - each slot allows for Sub-navigation, that is, they function as a mini-application.
  - you can place routes inside a slot folder, in that case, when accessing via <Link/> the rest of the slots will stay with current state.
  - if you access a slot inside a route refreshing the page, all non defined slots will fallback on a default.tsx, or throw a 404 if any of them don't have one.
Static Content: rendered as a hollow circle. Route pre-rendered at build time as static content.
Static Metadata File: defines metadata in form an object that can be placed in Pages and Layouts.
  - eg: export const metadata = {title: "Next.js", description: "Generated by Next.js"}
Static Rendering: server rendering strategy where we generate HTML pages at the time of building our application.
  - we can build the page once, cache it in a CDN, and serve it to the client almost instantly.
  - static rendering is the default rendering strategy in the app router.
  - all routes are automatically prepared at build time without additional step.
  - for Static Routes, the entire route is prefetched and cached by default.
Static Page: webpage that is pre-rendered at build time and served as-is to the user without requiring further processing on the server or client-side such as database consultations.
  - typically generated using Static Site Generation (SSG), a technique that creates HTML files for each page at build time.
Static-Site Generation (SSG): occurs at build time, when the application is deployed on the server.
  - ideal for content that doesn't change often, like blog posts.
  - it is a kind of Server-side solution.
Streaming: another Server Side rendering strategy that allows for progressive UI rendering from the server.
  - it is a Next concept but relies on the Suspense concept from React.
  - divide the work in chunks and stream it to the client as soon as it's ready.
  - enables users to see parts of the page immediately, before the entire content has finished rendering.
  - check HTTP Streaming.
  - to use it, import Suspense from React and Wrap objects that you want to use it.
  - don't forget to pass a fallback component.
Sub-navigation: inside a slot, you can navigate to a different slot, without reloading the whole page.
Suspense: allows you to wait for some code or data to load before rendering a component.
  - React doesn't have to wait for the code inside the Suspense component to render the rest of the page. The code for the Suspense is fed later (HTML streaming).
  - used to handle scenarios where you have asynchronous operations, such as data fetching or code splitting, and you want to provide a fallback UI while waiting for the data or code to become available.
  - HTML streaming on the server.
  - selective hydration on the client.
Template: similar but different from Layout. When a user navigates between routes that share a template, a new instance of the component is mounted.
  - DOM elements are recreated, state is not preserved, effects are re-synchronized.
template.tsx: name of the file to declare a template.
Time Based Data Revalidation: automatically revalidates data after a certain amount of time has passed.
  - is a middle ground between caching and no-caching.
  - to revalidate data at a timed interval, use the next option fetch to set the lifetime of the resource in seconds.
  - const response = await fetch("...", {next: {revalidate: 10}})
  - for pages, you can set the revalidate route segment configuration to establish the default revalidation time with:
  - export const revalidate = 10;
  - the lowest revalidate time across each layout and page of a single route will determine the revalidation frequency of the entire route.
title metadata: define the document title. It can be passed as a string in the key-value pair of the metadata, or as an object.
  - the object version has 3 keys: absolute, default and template.
  default: provides a default title to child elements that don't explicity specify a title.
  template: act as a layout for children pages.
  absolute: will ignore any template title set in parents.
Unmatched Routes: when slots have subroutes inside them, sibling slot may not have the same route.
URL Query Parameters: pass parameters to the request using ?query= notation in the URL
  - eg: localhost:3000/comments?query=first
  - with request.nextUrl.searchParams we can access all query parameters.
  - usually is used to filtering requests.
usePathname(): hook provided by Next.js that supplies the current route name (url after the domain).
  - it is useful to check which <Link> is active to give proper styling.
useRouter(): hook that allows you to access the router object inside any function component in your app.
  - with the router object, you can navigate Programatically.
  - router.push(/): handles client-side transitions
  - router.replace(): prevent adding a new URL entry into the history stack.
  - router.back(): navigate back in history.
  - router.reload(): reload the current URL.
Web Vitals: initiative created by Google to provide unified guidance and metrics to measure end-user page experience on the web.

tools and libs

turbopack: bundler designed to replace tools like Webpack for modern JavaScript and web development.
  - It is developed by the creators of Webpack and is optimized for performance and scalability.
  - Turbopack is used to bundle and optimize JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and other web assets for both development and production.
