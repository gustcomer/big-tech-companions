Babel
Build: broader process of preparing your application for deployment.
  - typically includes compilation but also involves additional steps to optimize the application.
  - combine all JavaScript, CSS, and other assets into a small number of files (or chunks) for efficient loading.
Compiler: compiler that optimizes React applications, ensuring that only the minimal parts of components and hooks will re-render when state changes.
  - usually it transform code from one form to another. For instance, transpile JSX into React.createElements calls.
  - compiling is just a part of the build process.
Component: fundamental building blocks used to create a user interface (UI).
  - could be Functional Components and Class Components.
  function Component(props, context, updater)
PureComponent: class component that automatically performs a shallow comparison of props and state to determine whether the component should re-render.
  - depending on the use case, a 
  RegularComponent will re-render every time the parent re-renders, even if the value prop hasnâ€™t changed.
  - for functional components, you can achieve similar behavior using React.memo:
ReactDOM.createRoot(): replaced the legacy API ReactDOM.render() and enables concurrent rendering by default.
  - appeared in react 18 and later.
ReactDOM.render(): old react-dom API that used synchronous rendering.
  - replaced by the new API ReactDOM.createRoot() that enables concurrent rendering by default.
ReactDOMRoot: represents the root of a React tree that uses React's new concurrent rendering features.
  - type of object returned by the ReactDOM.createRoot() method.
  - has a primary method .render() which is used to render a React component tree into the DOM.
  - appeared in react 18 and later.
  - Enables concurrent rendering by default.
