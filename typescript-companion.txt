any vs unknown

any:
  It allows a variable to be assigned to any value and bypasses most type
  checking. This means you can perform any operations on values of type any
  without getting type errors.

  gives you complete freedom but with the cost of losing type safety, making it
  easier to write code with type errors.

unknown:
  a type-safe counterpart to any. A variable of type unknown represents any
  value, just like any, but you cannot perform any operations directly on an
  unknown variable without first asserting or narrowing its type to a more
  specific type.

  requires you to work to understand what the type is before you can operate on
  it, leading to safer, more predictable code.

// Instead of
function unsafeFunction(param: any): any {
  // risky operation with 'param'
}

// Try
function saferFunction(param: unknown): unknown {
  if (typeof param === "string") {
    // now it's safer!
  }
}
