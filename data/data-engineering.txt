Data
  Structured (databases)
  Semi-structured (XML, JSON)
  Unstructured (audio, video, images)
Data Lake: centralized repository that allows storing large volumes of data from different types and sources, whether raw, structured, or unstructured, for future processing and analysis.
Data Warehouse: centralized repository designed to store, integrate, and analyze large volumes of structured data from various sources.
  - while data lakes store structured, semi and unstructured data, data warehouses store only structured data.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
Parquet: stores data by column rather than by row, making it highly efficient for analytical queries that access only a subset of columns.
