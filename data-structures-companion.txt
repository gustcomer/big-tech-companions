Tree (Traditional)

Tree: consists of nodes with parent-children relationships
Parent: upper node
Child: Node below
Root: the top node of a tree
Leaf: any node that does not have child nodes
  aka: Terminal Nodes, Outer Node, Terminal Node, External Node
Edges: the connection of one node to other nodes
  aka: Links

Ancestors: parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, etc
Descendants: children, grandchildren
Neighbor: parent or child
Subtree: a node and its descendants
Internal Node: any node of a tree that has child nodes
  aka: Inner Node, Inode, Branch Node
Siblings: children of the same parent
Forest: set of disjoint trees

Depth of a Node: number of ancestors
  or: number of edges along the unique path between it and the root node.
  aka: Level
Height of the Tree: maximum depth of any node
Degree of a Node: number of children
Degree of a Tree: maximum degree of a node in the tree
Distance between two nodes: number of edges along the shortest path
Size: number of nodes in the tree
Breadth of the Tree: the number of leaves

Invariants:
  each node must be connected to only one parent
  the root has no parent
  no node can be its own ancestor (there are no cycles or loops)
